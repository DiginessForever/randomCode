#I need to leave enough space in memory to do the neural net stuff.  I have 16GB (roughly 16,000,000,000 bits) of memory.  Should be enough.
#I do not want a lot of intermediate states though, so I'm going straight from the image list to a list of flattened ndarrays.
#I will ultimately make a batch out of these flattened arrays by sticking them end to end.
#Then on to the neural net stuff using Tensorflow.  Should be a simple matter of repeatedly sticking random batches into the input layer,
#doing feedforward & backpropagation, and leaving it running all night, next day...maybe a week or two.  At 9.2 Tflops, I'm sure it'll be as well
#trained as it's going to really get at that point.

#To Do:  
#1.  Create the neural net
#	a.  Create the input layer.
#	b.  Create a dropout layer (I wonder if these could be the same - I could actually just do dropout myself - step #4 above)
#	c.  Pooling layer (cover that again)
#	d.  Fully connected layers (3)
#	e.  Output layer

#2.  Convert output layer to something that makes sense.
#	a.  If I have two classes, the output layer should have two neurons.
#	b.  Each neuron should correspond to a class.
#	c.  The output function should display each class's probability.

#						Going to have to time the above methods and use the fastest.
#4.  Get a random selection of the flattened images from the total.
#5.  Create a batch (do we string them all together?).
#6.  Put the batch in the input layer of the neural net.
