	//The following is the W3C HTML5 enabled geolocation features, which attempt to get exact geolocation from the client device (cell phone)
	//It may rely on Google services to get information from your IP address (ISP location), nearby wifi SSIDs which have had the location mapped,
	//and perhaps the GPS of your phone.  This portion is kicked off by calling geoFindMe().  Untested.
	//https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W3C_Geolocation_API
	//https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/geolocation/  (functionality and configuration will vary by browser type)
	//Note that the user will get an HTML5 related scary looking notice about giving out information about their location - this is good -
	//your site should definitely have a specific purpose where it makes sense for the user to give the information to you.

	//The idea of including this section is ultimately to get the lat/long position and use it to call the appropriate location map tile with
	//Leaflet.
	//Note:  because different accuracy sources are used, the lat/long accuracy may vary widely.  We will need a way of determining which
	//location service was used to determine how accurate the position should be.  GPS (very accurate), wifi (reasonably accurate),
	//ISPs (not very accurate at all).
	//Future ideas - perhaps some way to use radio beacons in the area to determine position, which would allow you to be
	//certain no one was tracking you and gathering profile information for advertising or some other indeterminate purpose.
	//Decoupling Google functionality from this will therefore be an objective.

<!-- Later possible additions people could hack together off the top of my head:
	1.  We could figure out a way to display Jekyll data and the above in the same webpage (just having multiple divs
		and moving things around to make them fit).
	2.  We could work together to have an automatic set of data location feeds from various organizatons and keeping those updated.
	3.  We could make another set of functions with AJAX calls, and have a server that keeps track of people's locations while they drive.
		This would mean local traffic redirection around accidents or major slow downs.  It could be free of advertiser location profiling
		if maintained by a private org like us.
	4.  We could have automatic tag color updating for food establishments according to their last food safety inspection.
	5.  We could have automatic indicators of # stars / $$ level of business establishments, fed by reviews.
	6.  Maybe weather safety functionality fed by a local weather radar / station personnel.
	7.  Tweet interface - people could put #someLocation - and a bot could put tweets up in real time over the map by scanning Twitter.
	
	Long range possibilities (through interaction of this functionality with deeper analysis routines and graphs from APIs like Jekyll:
		It would be really nice if we could color areas by metrics like school standardized scores, violence ratings / robberies,
		#jobs/paylevel available (potentially by exact business location as well), 
		adjudication status of cases (maybe with pins over a courthouse),
		#of regulations versus inspectors - potentially linked with feed coming from legislature site (Do any of them deconflict their
		laws/regulations with past laws and remove or overhaul old laws that conflict?  Maybe we could encourage that.)
